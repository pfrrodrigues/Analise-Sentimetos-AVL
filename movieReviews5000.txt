... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .	
Alain Choquart 's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving Conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating .	
The kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman 's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself .	
A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .	
The Fast Runner ' transports the viewer into an unusual space	
Every joke is repeated at least four times .	
What you end up getting is the Vertical Limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between .

Noyce has worked wonders with the material .	
Wes Craven 's presence is felt ; not the Craven of ' A Nightmare on Elm Street ' or ` The Hills Have Eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of ` Deadly Friend . '	
, is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly .	
You may feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject .	
Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin .	
On a certain base level , Blue Crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .	
Gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it 's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek or laugh .	
The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .	
That 's because relatively nothing happens .	
` Snow Dogs ' has both .	
A decent-enough nail-biter that stands a good chance of being the big hit Franklin needs to stay afloat in Hollywood .	
The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .	
The impulses that produced this project ... are commendable , but the results are uneven .	
Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but Boyd 's film offers little else of consequence .	
As quiet , patient and tenacious as Mr. Lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline .	
Hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected Hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels .	
Squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , Burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .	
Topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs .	
It 's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .	
One of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society .	
A loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .	
... one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages ...	
The movie 's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story .	
With tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool .	
The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots .	
... a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that 's likely to irk viewers .	
A reality-snubbing hodgepodge .	
... grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces .	
The humor and humanity of Monsoon Wedding are in perfect balance .	
There are things to like about Murder By Numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements do n't gel .	
Quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and Moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between Jane Wyman and June Cleaver .	
What begins as a film in the tradition of The Graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant .	
Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .	
A brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel .	
The story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one .	
It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors .	
Some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the Ball and Chain .	
One of the funnier movies in town .	
The universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in ` Baran . '	
American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone .	
An elegant film	
An example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship .	
A plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .	
A stylistic romp that 's always fun to watch .	
Like its title character , this Nicholas Nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end .	
Although mainstream American movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel .	
Film ca n't quite maintain its initial momentum , but remains sporadically funny throughout .	
It seems impossible that an epic four-hour Indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is .	
A zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded Elvis fans -LRB- but by no means all -RRB- will have fun with .	
Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .	
Most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved	
There 's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a Hollywood career , if they want one .	
The movie turns out to be -LRB- Assayas ' -RRB- homage to the Gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .	
Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .	
Returning director Rob Minkoff ... and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin ... have done a fine job of updating White 's dry wit to a new age .	
The film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission ... if `` gory mayhem '' is your idea of a good time .	
That is because - damn it !	
It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .	
What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .	
This may be Burns 's strongest film since The Brothers McMullen .	
No better or worse than ` Truth or Consequences , N.M. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic Mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a Western backwater .	
Deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant .	
When twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives , hard-driving narcissism is a given , but what a world we 'd live in if Argento 's Hollywood counterparts ... had this much imagination and nerve .	
But it 's worth the concentration .	
Despite its promising cast of characters , Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . '	
But the second half of the movie really goes downhill .	
It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag .	
The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .	
A good music documentary , probably one of the best since The Last Waltz .	
It is a movie about passion .	
Certainly .	
But what 's nice is that there 's a casual intelligence that permeates the script .	
Lush and beautifully photographed -LRB- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -RRB- , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .	
... another example of how Sandler is losing his touch .	
This is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the American underground .	
A fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion .	
Efficient , suitably anonymous chiller .	
This follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter .	
The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .	
This movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad .	
Gently humorous and touching .	
At its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best .	
It cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you .	
Spider-Man is in the same category as X-Men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around .	
When the twist endings were actually surprising ?	
Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad .	
The last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others ' affections .	
Represents a worthy departure from the culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging Indian American cinema .	
A compelling film .	
The movie is well done , but slow .	
It is up to you to decide if you need to see it .	
Yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it 's so fascinating you wo n't be able to look away for a second .	
`` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' and I do n't mean that in a good way .	
I 'm not a fan of the phrase ` life affirming ' because it usually means ` schmaltzy , ' but Real Women Have Curves truly is life affirming .	
No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but The Guys still feels counterproductive .	
Offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a Hollywood film .	
The worst film of the year .	
` Christian Bale 's Quinn -LRB- is -RRB- a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like Gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '	
The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .	
Throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love 's brief moment .	
Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .	
A raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted Korean American stand-up 's I 'm the One That I Want .	
Painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed .	
The most brilliant and brutal UK crime film since Jack Carter went back to Newcastle , the first half of Gangster No. 1 drips with style and , at times , blood .	
Yes , I suppose it 's lovely that Cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but World Traveler gave me no reason to care , so I did n't .	
Broomfield is energized by Volletta Wallace 's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles .	
Yet the act is still charming here .	
The plot 's contrivances are uncomfortably strained .	
It has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you ...	
He drags it back , single-handed .	
It may not be `` Last Tango in Paris '' but ...	
A `` Home Alone '' film that is staged like `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .	
A rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by Epps .	
of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation	
Often hilarious .	
I 'm convinced I could keep a family of five blind , crippled , Amish people alive in this situation better than these British soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .	
An elegant work , Food of Love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing .	
The jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail .	
Give Shapiro , Goldman , and Bolado credit for good intentions , but there 's nothing here that they could n't have done in half an hour .	
... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .	
It 's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart .	
I like it .	
On its own , Big Trouble could be considered a funny little film .	
It 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .	
This tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same .	
Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .	
Makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases .	
A knowing sense of humor and a lot of warmth ignite Son of the Bride .	
Though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation .	
The Son Of The Bride 's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also is n't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues .	
Even if the Naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm .	
Ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints .	
Most of the things that made the original Men in Black such a pleasure are still there .	
At times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated -LRB- depending upon where you live -RRB- , Ignorant Fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two .	
Or for the year , for that matter .	
I had more fun watching Spy than I had with most of the big summer movies .	
It 's just merely very bad .	
the shackles	
Watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown .	
You can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you 've completely lowered your entertainment standards .	
Some movies blend together as they become distant memories .	
Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .	
Chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of ` ethnic cleansing . '	
Woody Allen used to ridicule movies like Hollywood Ending .	
It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it .	
And it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting .	
As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .	
They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .	
For all the dolorous trim , Secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers ' sporadic dips into pop Freudianism .	
Like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by Allen 's astringent wit .	
A taut , sobering film .	
Far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love .	
A muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any Scorsese has ever given us .	
The way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of Gator-bashing are consistently delightful .	
But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .	
Directed with purpose and finesse by England 's Roger Mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing , relatively lightweight commercial fare such as Notting Hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft .	
One of these days Hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there 's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations .	
A wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films .	
Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme .	
Lucky Break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it 's also drab and inert .	
Elvira fans could hardly ask for more .	
Exactly what you 'd expect from a guy named Kaos .	
Like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame .	
It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .	
... unlike -LRB- Scorsese 's Mean Streets -RRB- , Ash Wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .	
Only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .	
... the good and different idea -LRB- of middle-aged romance -RRB- is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend `` Never Again . ''	
Murder by Numbers ' is n't a great movie , but it 's a perfectly acceptable widget .	
It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''	
But it would be better to wait for the video .	
Delirious fun .	
There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .	
Special P.O.V. camera mounts on bikes , skateboards , and motorcycles provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense IMAX screen .	
There are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away .	
A fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , Blair Witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies .	
`` Interview '' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a TV episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into .	
... the first 2\/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices -LRB- cool visual backmasking -RRB- , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor ...	
This is the best Star Trek movie in a long time .	
Auto Focus is not your standard Hollywood bio-pic .	
`` Not really as bad as you might think ! ''	
Beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .	
Brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , Deuces Wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .	
One of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning .	
I saw Juwanna Mann so you do n't have to .	
Why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me .	
What starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film .	
... they missed the boat .	
Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .	
As an introduction to the man 's theories and influence , Derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it 's invaluable .	
A delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie .	
... Despite lagging near the finish line , the movie runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches . '	
Clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that does n't know what it wants to be when it grows up .	
Fear Dot Com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds .	
And Vin Diesel is the man .	
Nights feels more like a quickie TV special than a feature film ... It 's not even a TV special you 'd bother watching past the second commercial break .	
While there are times when the film 's reach exceeds its grasp , the production works more often than it does n't .	
Richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings .	
It 's a day at the beach -- with air conditioning and popcorn .	
... a bland , pretentious mess .	
The actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .	
Goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing ... but she and writing partner Laurence Coriat do n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage .	
The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged .	
Becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the Papin sisters .	
Though Harris is affecting at times , he can not overcome the sense that Pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities .	
The overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries .	
Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .	
An authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium .	
` Tadpole ' was one of the films so declared this year , but it 's really more of The Next Pretty Good Thing .	
Those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up .	
She 's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations .	
Even as I valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , I could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ...	
It may not be particularly innovative , but the film 's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding .	
At its best ... Festival in Cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in Cannes .	
Bill Morrison 's Decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful .	
-LRB- Shyamalan -RRB- turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count .	
I 'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than Evelyn this year .	
I know that I 'll never listen to Marvin Gaye or the Supremes the same way again	
Like Shrek , Spirit 's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world .	
Saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory .	
I 'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper .	
Tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here .	
Despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .	
And people make fun of me for liking Showgirls .	
You just know something terrible is going to happen .	
Much of what we see is horrible but it 's also undeniably exceedingly clever .	
Writer \/ director M. Night Shyamalan 's ability to pull together easily accessible stories that resonate with profundity is undeniable .	
Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '	
This 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .	
A long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral .	
Cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny .	
is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation .	
For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .	
The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .	
For a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .	
Not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens .	
would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera .	
This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .	
If you 're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you 're at the right film .	
Poignant and delicately complex .	
Intriguing and stylish .	
It was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at .	
It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .	
The trick when watching Godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them .	
A biopic about Crane 's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video .	
With exquisite craftsmanship ... Olivier Assayas has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois French society .	
However sincere it may be , The Rising Place never quite justifies its own existence .	
The central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest .	
What could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in Steven Soderbergh 's Traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .	
Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with Kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art .	
Skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you 're sure to get more out of the latter experience .	
You get the idea , though , that Kapur intended the film to be more than that .	
O.K. , not really .	
Both deserve better .	
Parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults .	
A tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more .	
The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies .	
Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .	
Even kids deserve better .	
That the real Antwone Fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle .	
Meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off Kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant .	
Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .	
Those unfamiliar with Mormon traditions may find The Singles Ward occasionally bewildering .	
Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .	
If The Last Man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .	
`` I blame all men for war , '' -LRB- the warden 's daughter -RRB- tells her father .	
If you do n't laugh , flee .	
that it 'll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture	
On its own , it 's not very interesting .	
Leigh is n't breaking new ground , but he knows how a daily grind can kill love .	
The rich performances by Friel -- and especially Williams , an American actress who becomes fully English -- round out the square edges .	
The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .	
The movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star Bruce Willis .	
Five screenwriters	
About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .	
Its one-sidedness ... flirts with propaganda .	
Final verdict : You 've seen it all before .	
Nicole Holofcenter , the insightful writer\/director responsible for this illuminating comedy does n't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully .	
One of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily .	
Even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .	
Boring and meandering .	
No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way .	
The emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task .	
Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs , seems inconceivable .	
Why ?	
Brosnan 's finest non-Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .	
It leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .	
A 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor .	
Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material .	
A reworking of Die Hard and Cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either .	
-LRB- The kid 's -RRB- just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .	
Texan director George Ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare .	
The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .	
Star Trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy .	
Ms. Phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either Esther 's initial anomie or her eventual awakening .	
The Wild Thornberrys Movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough .	
The audacity to view one of Shakespeare 's better known tragedies as a dark comedy is , by itself , deserving of discussion .	
Throw Smoochy from the train !	
If you 're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you 're in luck .	
De Ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter .	
Cold , Sterile And Lacking Any Color Or Warmth .	
Mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline .	
A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .	
In the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest .	
It 's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge .	
Secretary is not a movie about fetishism .	
` Film aficionados can not help but love Cinema Paradiso , whether the original version or new Director 's Cut . '	
A rip-off twice removed , modeled after -LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- earlier copycat Under Siege , sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat .

Except for Paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for Bartleby 's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .	
Absolutely not .	
The film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of Ms. Ambrose .

In the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more .	
It 's a very tasteful rock and roll movie .	
Spielberg has managed to marry science fiction with film noir and action flicks with philosophical inquiry .

Predictable and cloying , though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .	
It 's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that 's actually sort of amazing .	
Hollywood 's answer to an air ball .	
It 's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn .	
A sensitive , cultivated treatment of Greene 's work as well as a remarkably faithful one .	
A stylish thriller .	
For those who pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste , this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their \*\*\* off for an hour-and-a-half .	
As refreshing as a drink from a woodland stream .	
But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences

Arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year	
Nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .	
Lee 's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that Brown played in American culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability .	
This rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point .	
It is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual

A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .	
Humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .

Peralta 's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight .	
Meyjes 's movie , like Max Rothman 's future , does not work .

This off-putting French romantic comedy	
It 's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing .	
Amari has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances .	
As banal as the telling may be -- and at times , All My Loved Ones more than flirts with kitsch -- the tale commands attention .

Loud , silly , stupid and pointless .

Unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications .	
As the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , -LRB- Franco -RRB- has all of Dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability .

A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .	
Impostor is a step down for director Gary Fleder .	
Just because A Walk to Remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does n't mean it 's good enough for our girls .	
The fact that it is n't very good is almost beside the point .	
He has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper .	
While this gentle and affecting melodrama will have luvvies in raptures , it 's far too slight and introspective to appeal to anything wider than a niche audience .
