-1 Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .

2 The Santa Clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be .
0 Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .

-1 An unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity .
0 In between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and ` just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
0 A modestly surprising movie .
1 ... a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year .

-1 ` This movie sucks . '
0 Dignified CEO 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree .
-1 A sugar-coated Rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks .

0 More than anything else , Kissing Jessica Stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake Sleepless in Seattle again and again .
-1 Fast and funny , an action cartoon that 's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd .
0 After all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying .
0 Not only better than its predecessor , it may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season .
