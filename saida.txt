Sentimento : 0 -> Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash .	
Sentimento : -2 -> Because Eight Legged Freaks is partly an homage to Them , Tarantula and other low - budget B-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly -LRB- but not sophomoric -RRB- romp through horror and hellish conditions .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Spielberg 's realization of a near-future America is masterful .

Sentimento : 0 -> Eerily accurate depiction of depression .

Sentimento : 1 -> You bet there is and it 's what makes this rather convoluted journey worth taking .

Sentimento : 0 -> ... the one thing this Wild film has that other Imax films do n't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house .

Sentimento : 0 -> An awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .	
Sentimento : -1 -> The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Like Smoke Signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama

Sentimento : 0 -> Uneven but a lot of fun .

Sentimento : 0 -> If you saw it on TV , you 'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .

Sentimento : 0 -> Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement .	
Sentimento : 2 -> A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .	
Sentimento : 2 -> An earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool .

Sentimento : -1 -> Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents

Sentimento : -1 -> Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .	
Sentimento : 1 -> At a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism American moviemaking ever had , Godfrey Reggio 's career shines like a lonely beacon .

Sentimento : 0 -> The film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol .	
Sentimento : -1 -> The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Now as a former Gong Show addict , I 'll admit it , my only complaint is that we did n't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Genuinely unnerving .	
Sentimento : 1 -> The increasingly diverse French director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history .	
Sentimento : 0 -> One of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature .	
Sentimento : -3 -> A difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of Armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy .	
Sentimento : 0 -> One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .	
Sentimento : 0 -> In fact , even better .	
Sentimento : 0 -> ... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Proves that some movie formulas do n't need messing with -- like the big-bug movie .	
Sentimento : -1 -> An uplifting , largely bogus story .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances , the way to that destination is a really special walk in the woods .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Superbly photographed and staged by Mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen .	
Sentimento : 1 -> A mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last .	
Sentimento : 1 -> After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing	
Sentimento : 1 -> It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Too much of Storytelling moves away from Solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .	
Sentimento : 1 -> In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .	
Sentimento : 1 -> A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . '	
Sentimento : 0 -> First , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb .	
Sentimento : 0 -> I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .	
Sentimento : -1 -> ... silly humbuggery ...	
Sentimento : 1 -> Is n't as sharp as the original ... Despite some visual virtues , ` Blade II ' just does n't cut it .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A smart , arch and rather cold-blooded comedy .	
Sentimento : 0 -> -LRB- A -RRB- rather thinly-conceived movie .	
Sentimento : 2 -> Its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A slight but sweet film .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Got a David Lynch jones ?	
Sentimento : -1 -> Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Time of Favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .	
Sentimento : 0 -> `` Austin Powers in Goldmember '' has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end .	
Sentimento : -1 -> What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears ' first movie .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The filmmakers might want to look it up .	
Sentimento : 0 -> While maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among Wiseman 's warmest .	
Sentimento : 2 -> There is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A dreary movie .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .	
Sentimento : 1 -> To the filmmakers , Ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Using a stock plot , About a Boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Beating the Austin Powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness .	
Sentimento : 0 -> What begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Buy popcorn .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .	
Sentimento : 2 -> A well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .	
Sentimento : 1 -> -LRB- Allen 's -RRB- been making piffle for a long while , and Hollywood Ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Judith and Zaza 's extended bedroom sequence ... is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .	
Sentimento : 0 -> ... irritating soul-searching garbage .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies .	
Sentimento : 0 -> In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Proves mainly that South Korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their Hollywood counterparts .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Except it 's much , much better .	
Sentimento : 2 -> It is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film .	
Sentimento : 0 -> There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down .	
Sentimento : 0 -> has -RRB-	
Sentimento : 0 -> So original in its base concept that you can not help but get caught up .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .	
Sentimento : -1 -> If you ignore the cliches and concentrate on City by the Sea 's interpersonal drama , it ai n't half-bad .	
Sentimento : -1 -> A dreadful day in Irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment .	
Sentimento : 0 -> See it .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Nothing but an episode of Smackdown !	
Sentimento : 2 -> A guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A relative letdown .	
Sentimento : 0 -> ` Hey Arnold ! '	
Sentimento : 0 -> But though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The band performances featured in Drumline are red hot ... -LRB- but -RRB- from a mere story point of view , the film 's ice cold .	
Sentimento : -2 -> A non-mystery mystery .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story .	
Sentimento : -2 -> This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .	
Sentimento : 1 -> The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...	
Sentimento : -1 -> One of the most highly-praised disappointments I 've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Rock 's stand-up magic wanes .	
Sentimento : 2 -> Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Sadly , ` Garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as ` Wayne . '	
Sentimento : 1 -> With wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters ' striving solipsism .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It labours as storytelling .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?	
Sentimento : 0 -> The otherwise good-naturedness of Mr. Deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less - than-likely New York celebrities ... certainly raises the film above anything Sandler 's been attached to before .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .	
Sentimento : 0 -> ... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .	
Sentimento : 1 -> I just saw this movie ... well , it 's probably not accurate to call it a movie .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Though uniformly well acted , especially by young Ballesta and Galan -LRB- a first-time actor -RRB- , writer\/director Achero Manas 's film is schematic and obvious .	
Sentimento : 0 -> When you resurrect a dead man , Hard Copy should come a-knocking , no ?	
Sentimento : 1 -> If the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic Heaven will quite likely be more like hell .	
Sentimento : 1 -> It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .	
Sentimento : 2 -> For a movie audience , The Hours does n't connect in a neat way , but introduces characters who illuminate mysteries of sex , duty and love .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Too clever by about nine-tenths .	
Sentimento : 0 -> This is no `` Waterboy ! ''	
Sentimento : 0 -> They 're going through the motions , but the zip is gone .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The script 's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Not as good as the original , but what is ...	
Sentimento : 0 -> Those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give `` Scratch '' a second look .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable .	
Sentimento : -1 -> An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Resident Evil is what comes from taking John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars and eliminating the beheadings .	
Sentimento : -1 -> The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .	
Sentimento : 4 -> With or without the sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny , told well by a master storyteller	
Sentimento : 0 -> Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .	
Sentimento : 1 -> A terrific date movie , whatever your orientation .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny .	
Sentimento : 0 -> How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ?	
Sentimento : 0 -> Translation : ` We do n't need to try very hard . '	
Sentimento : 1 -> `` Frailty '' offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 .	
Sentimento : 1 -> An ambitious movie that , like Shiner 's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that do n't come off .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and Heaven is one such beast .	
Sentimento : 2 -> Very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Twenty years after its first release , E.T. remains the most wondrous of all Hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of Steven Spielberg 's misunderstood career .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance .	
Sentimento : -2 -> ... stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Nicely combines the enigmatic features of ` Memento ' with the hallucinatory drug culture of ` Requiem for a Dream . '	
Sentimento : 0 -> Every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny .	
Sentimento : 1 -> This ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Broder 's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Leguizamo and Jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Trying to figure out the rules of the Country Bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax Einstein 's brain .	
Sentimento : 0 -> `` Feardotcom '' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Delia , Greta , and Paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The beauty of Alexander Payne 's ode to the Everyman is in the details .	
Sentimento : 1 -> The town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of Don King , Sonny Miller , and Michael Stewart .	
Sentimento : 0 -> In this film , Aussie David Caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of Guy Ritchie .	
Sentimento : 0 -> As averse as I usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream Hollywood fantasies , this one got to me .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Maybe it is formula filmmaking , but there 's nothing wrong with that if the film is well-crafted and this one is .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Would you laugh if a tuba-playing dwarf rolled down a hill in a trash can ?	
Sentimento : -1 -> Loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness .	
Sentimento : 0 -> This misty-eyed Southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand .	
Sentimento : -1 -> To be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Despite its flaws ... Belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A porn film without the sex scenes .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The movie plays up the cartoon 's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour , I 'm going to recommend SECRETARY , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal , and also the unique way Shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl -	
Sentimento : 1 -> Despite slick production values and director Roger Michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .	
Sentimento : 0 -> `` Barbershop '' is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story .	
Sentimento : 1 -> A soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for NBA properties .	
Sentimento : 0 -> An ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Consistently clever and suspenseful .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud .	
Sentimento : 2 -> A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Bearable .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression .	
Sentimento : -1 -> But Kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them .	
Sentimento : 0 -> See it for his performance if nothing else .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of Jia with his family .	
Sentimento : 0 -> I walked away from this new version of E.T. just as I hoped I would -- with moist eyes .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama .	
Sentimento : 1 -> plays like some corny television production from a bygone era	
Sentimento : 0 -> It 's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming Washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke	
Sentimento : 0 -> Here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Some Body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Though writer\/director Bart Freundlich 's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of Crudup 's anchoring performance .	
Sentimento : 0 -> -LRB- Carvey 's -RRB- characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark .	
Sentimento : 0 -> This beautifully animated epic is never dull .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Charming and witty , it 's also somewhat clumsy .	
Sentimento : -2 -> In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes .	
Sentimento : -1 -> frustratingly refuses to give Pinochet 's crimes a political context	
Sentimento : 0 -> Paul Bettany playing Malcolm McDowell ?	
Sentimento : 0 -> A serviceable Euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom -- handguns , BMWs and seaside chateaus .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film 's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A nearly 21\/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Seems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like Clueless Does South Fork .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Evokes a palpable sense of disconnection , made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The concept is a hoot .	
Sentimento : 1 -> A straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they 've rarely been given .	
Sentimento : -1 -> The directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge	
Sentimento : 0 -> What Eric Schaeffer has accomplished with Never Again may not , strictly speaking , qualify as revolutionary .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .	
Sentimento : 0 -> What can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ?	
Sentimento : 0 -> Ca n't seem to get anywhere near the story 's center .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Even with its $ 50-million US budget , Pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Like most of Jaglom 's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of stylistic elements .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Just bring on the Battle Bots , please !	
Sentimento : 0 -> Sweet Home Alabama is n't going to win any Academy Awards , but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n't feeling any of it .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .	
Sentimento : 1 -> The young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .	
Sentimento : 0 -> In some ways , Lagaan is quintessential Bollywood .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .	
Sentimento : 1 -> A wry , affectionate delight .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Credit director Ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The auteur 's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Gets better after Foster leaves that little room .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity , the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Friday After Next is the kind of film that could only be made by African-Americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards African-Americans .	
Sentimento : 0 -> As lively an account as Seinfeld is deadpan .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women 's depression .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Imagine a film that begins as a Seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of The Shining , The Thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Definitely funny stuff , but it 's more of the ` laughing at ' variety than the ` laughing with . '	
Sentimento : 0 -> A heartening tale of small victories and enduring hope .	
Sentimento : 0 -> An emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema .	
Sentimento : -1 -> An extremely unpleasant film .	
Sentimento : -1 -> More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A puzzling experience .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Jonah is only so-so ... the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it .	
Sentimento : -1 -> I hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Intelligent and moving .	
Sentimento : 0 -> This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Mark Wahlberg ... may look classy in a '60s - homage pokepie hat , but as a character he 's dry , dry , dry .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended .	
Sentimento : -1 -> As Warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he 's neglected over the years .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It should have stayed there .	
Sentimento : -1 -> ... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .	
Sentimento : -1 -> It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .	
Sentimento : -1 -> There 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .	
Sentimento : 0 -> There is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Romantic , riveting and handsomely animated .	
Sentimento : -2 -> This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary .	
Sentimento : 0 -> As saccharine as it is disposable .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A subtle , poignant picture of goodness that is flawed , compromised and sad .	
Sentimento : 0 -> An exceptionally acted , quietly affecting cop drama .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , About Schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness .	
Sentimento : 1 -> She nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed .	
Sentimento : 0 -> So exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre .	
Sentimento : -3 -> The film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The cast comes through even when the movie does n't .	
Sentimento : -2 -> A rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics .	
Sentimento : -1 -> It 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate Gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Innocuous enough to make even Jean-Claude Van Damme look good .	
Sentimento : 0 -> But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .	
Sentimento : 0 -> But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .	
Sentimento : 0 -> I stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .	
Sentimento : -1 -> One Hour Photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it 's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director Mark Romanek 's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin .	
Sentimento : 0 -> With a confrontational stance , Todd Solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A processed comedy chop suey .	
Sentimento : 0 -> eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation .	
Sentimento : 2 -> Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .	
Sentimento : 0 -> So purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it 's a fairly straightforward remake of Hollywood comedies such as Father of the Bride .	
Sentimento : 1 -> An intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist -LRB- not to mention gently political -RRB- meditation on the values of knowledge , education , and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement .	
Sentimento : -1 -> I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in Renaissance Spain , and the fact that it 's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling .	
Sentimento : 2 -> The Santa Clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .

Sentimento : 0 -> Highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Goes on and on to the point of nausea .	
Sentimento : 0 -> -LRB- Raimi 's -RRB- matured quite a bit with Spider-Man , even though it 's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you 'll ever see .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It 's about as convincing as any other Arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic .	
Sentimento : -1 -> An unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity .	
Sentimento : 0 -> In between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and ` just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '	
Sentimento : 0 -> A modestly surprising movie .	
Sentimento : 1 -> ... a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Combines improbable melodrama -LRB- gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas -RRB- with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched .	
Sentimento : 0 -> This is one of Mr. Chabrol 's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny .	
Sentimento : -1 -> This one is strictly a lightweight escapist film .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .	
Sentimento : 0 -> If the title is a Jeopardy question , then the answer might be `` How does Steven Seagal come across these days ? ''	
Sentimento : 0 -> Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .	
Sentimento : -1 -> There is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane .	
Sentimento : -1 -> ` This movie sucks . '	
Sentimento : 0 -> Dignified CEO 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree .	
Sentimento : -1 -> A sugar-coated Rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .	
Sentimento : 1 -> What sets this romantic comedy apart from most Hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The film 's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Barry Sonnenfeld owes Frank the Pug big time	
Sentimento : -1 -> One gets the impression the creators of Do n't Ask Do n't Tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man 's downfall , brought about by his lack of self-awareness .	
Sentimento : 0 -> After that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Blue Crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .	
Sentimento : -1 -> A small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as Demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .	
Sentimento : -1 -> While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The color sense of Stuart Little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie were n't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is .

Sentimento : 0 -> As the movie dragged on , I thought I heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Will certainly appeal to Asian cult cinema fans and Asiaphiles interested to see what all the fuss is about .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes .	
Sentimento : 2 -> Standing in the Shadows of Motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow .	
Sentimento : -1 -> This is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A thriller whose style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story , you can not separate them .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It 's mostly a pleasure to watch .	
Sentimento : -1 -> The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Nair and writer Laura Cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that 's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Goofy , nutty , consistently funny .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Audiard successfully maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Welles groupie\/scholar Peter Bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he 's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant William Randolph Hearst .

Sentimento : -1 -> Fans of so-bad-they 're - good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess .	
Sentimento : 2 -> We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine .	
Sentimento : 2 -> Mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances ... and excellent use of music by India 's popular Gulzar and Jagjit Singh .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A perceptive , good-natured movie .	
Sentimento : 0 -> This is n't a stand up and cheer flick ; it 's a sit down and ponder affair .	
Sentimento : -1 -> One of the pleasures in Walter 's documentary ... is the parade of veteran painters , confounded dealers , and miscellaneous bohos who expound upon the subject 's mysterious personality without ever explaining him .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Adrift , Bentley and Hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as Ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .	
Sentimento : 1 -> The real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star , Jean Reno , who resembles Sly Stallone in a hot sake half-sleep .	
Sentimento : 0 -> And there 's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after Greene 's story ends .

Sentimento : 1 -> The next big thing 's not-so-big -LRB- and not-so-hot -RRB- directorial debut .	
Sentimento : 0 -> If you 're content with a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director 's life , Eisenstein delivers .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Overly long and worshipful bio-doc .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects .	
Sentimento : 2 -> There is something that is so meditative and lyrical about Babak Payami 's boldly quirky Iranian drama Secret Ballot ... a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of Middle Eastern world politics	
Sentimento : -1 -> It 's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but Westbrook 's foundation and Dalrymple 's film earn their uplift .

Sentimento : -1 -> I ca n't remember the last time I saw a movie where I wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail .

Sentimento : -1 -> Chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Though Haynes ' style apes films from the period ... its message is not rooted in that decade .

Sentimento : 0 -> It is an indelible epic American story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It 's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest .	
Sentimento : 0 -> ... -LRB- the film -RRB- works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay .	
Sentimento : 0 -> You walk out of The Good Girl with mixed emotions -- disapproval of Justine combined with a tinge of understanding for her actions .	
Sentimento : -2 -> The movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .	
Sentimento : -1 -> This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .	
Sentimento : 2 -> The immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary Space Station 3D .	
Sentimento : -1 -> A tired , unnecessary retread ... a stale copy of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and The Last Kiss ... provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It challenges , this nervy oddity , like modern art should .	
Sentimento : 5 -> Read My Lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love .	
Sentimento : 0 -> An hour and a half of joyful solo performance .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Like its parade of predecessors , this Halloween is a gory slash-fest .	
Sentimento : -2 -> Better than the tepid Star Trek : Insurrection ; falls short of First Contact because the villain could n't pick the lint off Borg Queen Alice Krige 's cape ; and finishes half a parsec -LRB- a nose -RRB- ahead of Generations .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Exploits -LRB- headbanger -RRB- stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It 's just rather leaden and dull .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Although the subject matter may still be too close to recent national events , the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters .	
Sentimento : -1 -> A deeply felt and vividly detailed story about newcomers in a strange new world .	
Sentimento : -1 -> The film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .	
Sentimento : 1 -> From the opening strains of the Average White Band 's `` Pick up the Pieces '' , you can feel the love .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Triple X is a double agent , and he 's one bad dude .	
Sentimento : 2 -> There has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently ... but Peter Mattei 's Love in the Time of Money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive -LRB- if tragic -RRB- note .	
Sentimento : 2 -> This is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek -LRB- as well as a serious debt to The Road Warrior -RRB- , but it feels like unrealized potential	
Sentimento : 0 -> As an actress , Madonna is one helluva singer .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The filmmakers ' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the girls ' environment .	
Sentimento : 1 -> It wraps up a classic mother\/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it 's not all new , at least it looks pretty .	
Sentimento : -1 -> or maybe `` How will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of The Rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? ''	
Sentimento : -2 -> Enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers .	
Sentimento : 0 -> How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ?	
Sentimento : 0 -> Only at the prospect of Beck 's next project .	
Sentimento : 0 -> ... a vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll .	
Sentimento : 2 -> A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of Bible parables and not an actual story .	
Sentimento : -2 -> They can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental .	
Sentimento : -1 -> It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Why spend $ 9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ?	
Sentimento : 0 -> Evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking .	
Sentimento : -1 -> All three actresses are simply dazzling , particularly Balk , who 's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents .	
Sentimento : -2 -> The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .	
Sentimento : 1 -> You may be captivated , as I was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why Paul Thomas Anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which Adam Sandler will probably ever appear .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Ver Wiel 's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of Critical Jim two-dimensional and pointless .	
Sentimento : -1 -> So vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted Rembrandt .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .	
Sentimento : -1 -> In other words , it 's badder than bad .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Wedding feels a bit anachronistic .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade .	
Sentimento : 0 -> With an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera	
Sentimento : 0 -> You can see where Big Bad Love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Statham employs an accent that I think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass American but sometimes just lapses into unhidden British .	
Sentimento : 0 -> If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than High Crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` do n't care about the truth . ''	
Sentimento : 0 -> So boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there	
Sentimento : 0 -> Rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The Hours , a delicately crafted film , is an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Showtime 's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment .	
Sentimento : 0 -> -LRB- Dong -RRB- makes a valiant effort to understand everyone 's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that Family Fundamentals gets you riled up .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Light the candles , bring out the cake and do n't fret about the calories because there 's precious little substance in Birthday Girl -- it 's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat .	
Sentimento : 0 -> In his debut as a director , Washington has a sure hand .	
Sentimento : 0 -> -- but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies I 've had in a while .	
Sentimento : 2 -> This is not Chabrol 's best , but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death .	
Sentimento : 2 -> It 's a glorious spectacle like those D.W. Griffith made in the early days of silent film .	
Sentimento : -1 -> The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .	
Sentimento : 2 -> The year 's greatest adventure , and Jackson 's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate .	
Sentimento : 0 -> If this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative .	
Sentimento : 1 -> When all is said and done , she loves them to pieces -- and so , I trust , will you .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Director Claude Chabrol has become the master of innuendo .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Woven together handsomely , recalling sixties ' rockumentary milestones from Lonely Boy to Do n't Look Back .	
Sentimento : 1 -> It 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars	
Sentimento : 0 -> Paul Cox needed to show it .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The huskies are beautiful , the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent .

Sentimento : 0 -> moved	
Sentimento : 0 -> Nearly every attempt at humor here is DOA .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness .	
Sentimento : 1 -> This movie is to be cherished .	
Sentimento : 1 -> The Bard as black comedy -- Willie would have loved it .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .	
Sentimento : 2 -> While Tattoo borrows heavily from both Seven and The Silence of the Lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .	
Sentimento : -1 -> The film is ... determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , Scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it 's documenting .	
Sentimento : -3 -> While it is interesting to witness the conflict from the Palestinian side , Longley 's film lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Producer John Penotti surveyed high school students ... and came back with the astonishing revelation that `` they wanted to see something that did n't talk down to them . ''	
Sentimento : 1 -> A real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Ultimate X is a ride , basically the kind of greatest-hits reel that might come with a subscription to ESPN the Magazine .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and Woo 's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie 's heart .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Jones ... makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $ 1.8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of Job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture .	
Sentimento : 0 -> I 'd watch these two together again in a New York minute .

Sentimento : 1 -> No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .	
Sentimento : 0 -> ... a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on Rice 's second installment of her Vampire Chronicles .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Poetry in motion captured on film .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws .	
Sentimento : 0 -> None of Birthday Girl 's calculated events take us by surprise ...	
Sentimento : 0 -> Twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , Clint Eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him .	
Sentimento : 1 -> It 's like a `` Big Chill '' reunion of the Baader-Meinhof Gang , only these guys are more harmless pranksters than political activists .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Ms. Hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about Zelda 's ultimate fate .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Really is a pan-American movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse .

Sentimento : 0 -> Crikey indeed .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It 's exactly what you 'd expect .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting .	
Sentimento : -1 -> You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .	
Sentimento : 0 -> A stirring road movie .	
Sentimento : -1 -> If you 've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart .	
Sentimento : 1 -> It has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing .

Sentimento : 0 -> Just send it to Cranky .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Steven Soderbergh does n't remake Andrei Tarkovsky 's Solaris so much as distill it .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .	
Sentimento : 2 -> In theory , a middle-aged romance pairing Clayburgh and Tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Works better in the conception than it does in the execution ... winds up seeming just a little too clever .	
Sentimento : 0 -> New Yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell ...	
Sentimento : 0 -> Vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much .	
Sentimento : 2 -> With all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen ... His Secret Life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Van Wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest .	
Sentimento : 0 -> No , even that 's too committed .	
Sentimento : 1 -> The large-frame IMAX camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Low comedy does n't come much lower .	
Sentimento : -1 -> The characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of Scooter .	
Sentimento : 0 -> dramatic snapshot	
Sentimento : 0 -> What we get ... is Caddyshack crossed with the Loyal Order of Raccoons .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It 'll keep you wide awake and ... very tense .	
Sentimento : -1 -> The movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story , Minac drains his movie of all individuality .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that can not be denied .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Less an examination of neo-Nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Though few will argue that it ranks with the best of Herzog 's works , Invincible shows he 's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film .	
Sentimento : 0 -> While it may not add up to the sum of its parts , Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .	
Sentimento : 0 -> There are no special effects , and no Hollywood endings .	
Sentimento : -1 -> Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .	
Sentimento : 1 -> Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .	
Sentimento : -2 -> From a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving French drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times .	
Sentimento : 2 -> The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .	
Sentimento : 2 -> A stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help Chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact .

Sentimento : 0 -> For most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche .

Sentimento : 1 -> A sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It pulls the rug out from under you , just when you 're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual DVD release will offer subtitles and the original Italian-language soundtrack .	
Sentimento : 0 -> It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...	
Sentimento : 2 -> The creative animation work may not look as fully ` rendered ' as Pixar 's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree .

Sentimento : 0 -> An EXIT sign , that is .	
Sentimento : 1 -> It 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .	
Sentimento : 0 -> The Emperor 's Club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality .	
Sentimento : -1 -> ... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .	
Sentimento : 0 -> Its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy .
